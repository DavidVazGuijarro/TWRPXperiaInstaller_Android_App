        TWRP Recovery Installer for Xperia
        \n\n
        This app downloads latest TWRP image for your phone
        and flashes it to the FOTAKernel partition.
        \n\n
        All custom ROMs (FXP, AOKP, CM, PAC, AOSPA etc)
        support the extract_elf_ramdisk method in which
        the recovery present inside the FOTAKernel partition
        is used. This recovery will work regardless of if the
        recovery in kernel is working or not.
        \n\n
        NOTE: The recovery.img files are hosted on goo.im so when
        downloading, first just an html page is downloaded. Open the
        page, and come back to the app and press the download button
        for the real download of recovery to begin. (~10mb size)
